Bipartite graphs:
A graph is called as bipartite if we can color all the nodes of the graph using only two colors such that no two adjadent nodes have same color.

observations:
1. All the linear graphs(having no cycle) are bipartite.
2. graphs with cycle length as even are also bipartite.
3. graphs with cycle length as odd are not bipartite.

Topological sorting(DFS):
Linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between u and v, u appears before v in that ordering.
1. applicable only on DAG

Kahn's Algorithm:
used for topological sorting(using BFS)
Algorith
1. Take an array of size V and insert the indegrees of each node corresponding to its index.
2. Insert all the nodes with 0 indegree into queue and append in answer.
3. Start popping out from queue and perform BFS and reduce the indegree of each neighbour node.
4. If neighbour node indegree becomes 0, insert into queue and append in answer.
